# Article IV. Answering Alarms &
Attendance

## Section 4.01 Meetings
Meetings shall be held on any Monday nights from 6:00 P.M. until 9:00 P.M. To conduct
a business meeting, a minimum of two (2) Operational Officers must be present, one of
which must be a chief level officer. Business meetings shall be held on any Monday of
the month, beginning by 7:00 P.M. Non-business meeting Mondays shall be left open for
all of the following: truck maintenance/upkeep, station maintenance/upkeep, and training.
Members shall strive to attend special meetings or work details called by the Fire Chief
or his or her designee. The Fire Chief or his designee shall be responsible for recording
all attendance and training activities by the membership.

## Section 4.02 Calls
All members shall strive to answer all alarms and calls for assistance in emergencies and
civil defense. While answering alarms, members (with exception of operational officers)
shall proceed to the station or respond according to the Best Practices Guidelines.
Members shall not be permitted to pass by the station, to respond on alarms in POV,
unless otherwise advised by the Officer in Charge. The Fire Chief may from time to time
issue General Orders modifying alarm response. Members will remain on the scene of
the emergency until dismissed by the Officer in Charge. Members will proceed to the
station when dismissed from the scene to assist in preparing and readying the equipment
and apparatus for answering additional
alarms, unless otherwise directed. Members shall remain on duty at the station until such
time as the Officer in Charge dismisses them. Officers in Charge should not hold members
longer than necessary. Any member leaving the station before being dismissed by the
Officer in Charge may be subject to disciplinary action.

## Section 4.03 Active and In-Active Status
Membership shall have a “three strike” rule to remain on “Active Status”. In any calendar
month, if a member cannot attend (1) one call, or,(1) one meeting, or (1) department
event, such as an official training night then a representative of the department will get in
contact with said member to determine their eligibility for remaining on “Active Status”,
with non-compliant members placed in an “In-Active Status”. This representative will be
an Operational Officer appointed by the Fire Chief with the intent of maintaining integrity
and accuracy in member status, as well as consistently in reporting. They will be
required to provide a copy of attendance to The Board and the Fire Chief every month
for review.

Any Member placed on In active status shall be reviewed by the Board at the next
regularly scheduled Board meeting. Also, upon being placed on In-Active status, The
Board shall submit a certified letter and email to the member. The Board President and
Chief must be copied on email correspondence. If said member fails to fulfill Active
status requirements for a second consecutive month, or the member is moved to In-
Active status two times in a calendar year, the member shall be dismissed from the
department, at which time they will be required to return all equipment issued by the
DVFD. In-active members returning to active duty shall go through a ninety (90) day re-
training process, serving as a probationary period (as stated in Article V, Section 5.01),
before returning to Active Status.

## Section 4.04 Excused Absences
Any member shall be excused from attending for any of the following reasons:
Employment or job related activities, academic schedule, illness or injury, family
emergency or bereavement and military service. Any and all disciplinary action beyond
this is subject to Article V of these by laws. If a vote is held during which a member is
granted an excused absence in accordance with this section, the member has the
option to make a vote indirectly, either by phone call, text message, or email to an
Operational Officer in attendance of the meeting.
